A creative writing teacher once gave me advice about writing fiction that I'm going to apply to a few things that aren't writing fiction. The advice is, *Write for one person, not an audience.* What he meant was, don't try and satisfy everyone, it's pointless. He also meant, break out of the usual way of deciding if what you're writing is 'good'.

The usual way of deciding if our work is good, whether it's fiction or anything else, is to ask 'Will people like this?', which often disguises the question, 'Is this as good as things that are popular?' Those are resonable questions to ask. When a lot of people like something, it tends to be good. It means there's something to it. And so, it's often the case that we try to measure the worth of the things we make by comparing them to the popular things that are already out there. When I wrote fiction in class, I had contemporary short stories in mind, and tried to make sure that my stories were like those, so that they would be 'good.' When I write code now, I compare the project I'm writing to the existing projects I see. I try and make sure that my project measures up to other successful projects in scope, usability, and quality. And on balance, that's a very good thing to think about. But if it's the *only* thing you think about -- well, then you can run into a few problems.

In my fiction, I ran into the problem that my stories felt bland and unsurprising. They were a little bit like offbrand cereal; not particularly tasty, and only appealing because they resemble the real thing. In my code projects, I ran into a different problem -- what developers call *scope creep*, and what everyone else calls biting off more than you can chew. There are one or two half-chewed codebases on my github because I took on a project of the same scope as a popular project.
