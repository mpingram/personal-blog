Here are three of my hobbies\: I write fiction, I make electronic music, and I cook. I enjoy the process of cooking and I generally think the food that I cook is good, because I think it tastes good to me. With my electronic music or my fiction, it's almost the opposite. Writing fiction can feel like pulling teeth, and the end result I usually think of as being bad. I enjoy the process of starting a song when I'm writing music, but finishing a song can also feel like pulling teeth, and on the whole I have what must be something like several hundred excellent 30 second snippets but only one or two finished songs that I think are 'good.'

Why is that?

I worked so hard for this. I spent hours at the library after work for this. I felt a fire under my ass for this. I intentionally didn't imagine this because imagining it seemed unrealistic. Here I am, and I'm unhappy and I want to leave. I've barely made a dent in the work I need to do today. I've just typed. An insignificant fraction of that typing was spent on things that needed to get done. Most of it was spent guiltily trying to appear as though I'm working while whittling away time. Why am I doing this? I feel awful here. I want to leave, but I can't, because I need to finish the calculator, which I continually find excuses not to do.

Why is that? It was my choice. I did it and made it happen. I need to leave, this isn't how my life can be allowed to go. I spend 9 hours of my day doing something I don't enjoy, in an empty office by myself. How did that happen? I chose it and did it on purpose. All me.

What's wrong with me? This is supposed to be important, to important to waste it on this. It's words and instructions to a computer that I need to give it. I need to give those instructions to the computer whether I am feeling happy or sad, important or incompetent, because it needs to be done to accomplish Objectives and achieve Outcomes. What's wrong with me? Why can't I drag myself through this?



I make electronic music and I write fiction. I've been doing both of them for years and years now, with the result that I'm very experienced at editing audio and I'm good at writing sentences. I've written a lot of great 10-second snippets of music, and I've written some really superb sentences. In fact, I think the best feedback I ever got on my writing, which came from a classmate in a creative writing class, was "If a story was a sequence of good sentences, this would be a great story."

Obviously, stories aren't just sequences of good sentences. There's *something else* about stories that makes them matter to us or not matter, something that can shine through artless and bland sentences, the same way a black-and-white photo of the Mona Lisa is still the Mona Lisa. <<fiction example>>

I don't think there's a good word for the something else that makes a story matter or not matter. I think we have to make do with words like 'good stories' and 'bad stories', which sound too objective, or 'stories that matter' and 'stories that don't matter', which doesn't really work either, because not only is it judgy, it's also hard to justify. Stories don't do anything, and they don't even make people do anything. They only rarely contain explicit instructions or easily give up their meaning. Maybe no stories 'matter', or maybe they all matter a lot. It seems useless to argue one way or the other, because you can just move the goalposts depending on what you think matters.

If stories were food, then we'd be lucky, because then we'd have a ready-made concept that distinguishes 'good food' from 'bad food', which we can call *tastiness*. There's loose agreement on what food is tasty and what food isn't, with a lot of variation. Dog food and MREs are probably rarely considered tasty. Carefully-arranged and artfully plated food at a fancy restaurant can be very tasty, and an untamed mass of steaming deliciousness in one of those styrofoam cafeteria containers can be very tasty. And adding to the confusion, tastiness has everything to do with specific things about you. Maybe you became vegetarian ten years ago, and a burger that you might have loved as a child is literally unprocessable by your body now. Maybe you just don't like cilantro. Maybe a meal was particularly tasty because you were just really, really hungry for it. The best breakfast I've ever had, of all time bar none, was at a packed airport in Toronto where my family and I had been stranded overnight without food. It was bacon and scrambled eggs, with toast and orange juice. It changed my life and I'll never forget it.

When it comes to food, this is all obvious. But I never stopped to realize it was true about fiction, too. I never enjoyed writing fiction, and I never managed to write anything truly tasty. (The opposite is true of my cooking, I'm happy to say.)
