I'm a perfectionist, both when it comes to making things and when it comes to enjoying them. With code, fiction, movies, videogames, and poetry, imperfections [ruin things for me.] I don't think that's a good thing. I think being a perfectionist really means confusing the world of ideas with the world of reality; everything is perfect in concept, becuase there isn't a high enough level of detail for the imperfections to exist. 

[why is it good news?]
